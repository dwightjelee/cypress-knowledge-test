# Automation Testing with Cypress

This project contains automated tests for the website [Automation in Testing](https://automationintesting.online/).

## Running Cypress Tests

1. **Write tests**:
   Open the test file `cypress/e2e/contactform.cy.ts` and finish the tests by fulfilling the TODO's found in the file.

2. **Open Cypress**:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```
   This command will open the Cypress Test Runner where you can see and run all the test files.

3. **Run Tests from CLI**:
    ```bash
    npx cypress run
    ```
   This command will run all the tests in the project from the command line.

## Test Files

The test files are located in the `cypress/e2e` directory.

### Fixing TODO Comments

Ensure all TODO comments in the test files are resolved and the tests are functioning as expected. Follow the guidelines and best practices mentioned in the Cypress documentation for writing effective tests.
